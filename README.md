*MACHINE LEARNING- Predicting Credit Risk*

Build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

*Background*
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.
Use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

*Instructions*
Retrieve the data
The data is located in the Resources folder.
->lending_data.csv
Import the data using Pandas.

*Consider the models*
Create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before creating, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.
